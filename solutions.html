<h1>How to save AC Milan</h1>
<h3>Solution 1, Manager</h3>
<p>
    First off We have to address the manager, I believe he will last until the end of the summer before eventually being let go.
    The player who many believe would help bring milan back to the top is Sérgio Conceição, the former Porto manager. His playstyle 
    is a lot more defensive than Fonseca and his predecessor which is clinical for Milan since they have been struggling defensively 
    for almost three years now. His play style is more rigid which will help the players concede less, while also being able to bring
    some of his former players like Nico Gonzalez or Alan Varela. Many were asking for him in the summer, with him even leaving his former
    club, however the management went for the riskier option which has paid off less. Other options would include Pallardino (Fiorentina
    Manager), Igor Tudor (Former Lazio manager) and Eden Terzic. 
</p>
<h3>
    Solution 2, The players
</h3>
<p>
    Secondly we have to address the players, there are currently too many here that simply don't belong, the likes of: </p>
    <li>Calabria</li>
    <li>Emerson Royal</li>
    <li>Pavlovic</li>
    <li>Tomori</li>
    <li>Ruben Loftus-Cheek</li>
    <li>Jovic</li>

<p>
    Should not be at the club if they have any intentions to being one of sportings best teams. They should be replaced with players
    like:
</p>
    <li>Tiago Santos (Lille)</li>
    <li>Michael Kayode (Fiorentina)</li>
    <li>Giorgio Scalvini (Atalanta)</li>
    <li>Jorrel Hato (Ajax)</li>
    <li>Samuele Ricci (Torino)</li>
    <li>Mateo Retegui (Atalanta)</li>

<h3>Solution 3, The Owner and Management</h3>
<p>
    Lastly we have the most important problem to solve, The management. First off the easiest thing to do is move Moncada back to 
    his position as a scout since he was really good at that. Next Milan would need to find a new sporting director. The best
    solution for this would be Tony D'Amico, the current Atalanta sporting director, who has building A successful Atalanta team 
    for the last two seasons with great transfers that eventually he cashed out on for far greater thn he signed players for.
    Next Milan should remove Zlatan's role of Authority as it is clear he isn't doing anything except messing around and using the
    position for clout and only mentioning that he's here when milan win. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem likely that Gerry Cardinale or 
    Furlani will be leaving anytime soon so it seems best to focus on the people around them.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
    In Conclusion Milan definitely has work to do if they want to get back to europe's greatest however it all starts with turning this season 
    around, Forza Milan!
</p>
