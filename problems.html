<title>Milan's Problems</title>

<h3 style="color: purple;">Problem 1, the Manager Paolo Fonseca</h3>
<p>
    Paolo Fonseca, the current coach for AC Milan was deemed by many fans to be a side step from the former coach, Stefano Pioli
    who a lot of people said had overstayed his welcome at the club. Paolo Fonseca has never managed big teams in comparison to Milan, with
    his only other jobs of relative notice are Roma, which he failed at and got sacked (fired) and Lille which was the club Milan
    took him from. His main problem this season has been dealing with the weaker teams and failing to keep a level of consistency which
    has costed milan a lot of points in the league unnecessarily against teams such as Parma, Cagliari, and Torino which has seen Milan be 
    currently sitting in 7th, and 6 points off 6th place. He can pull off really good results against big teams like Inter and Real Madrid
    but when he constantly sets up his team in ways that give the weaker teams a chance which typically ends up in very close games or lost 
    points. I believe he will last until the end of the season with Milan missing out on Champions League spots, which will anger the 
    Management who will lose a lot of revenue because of missed qualification in europe's biggest competition.
</p>

<h3 style="color: blueviolet;">Problem 2, Players</h3>
<p>
    There are many players at the club that really shouldn't be at the club if the team would
    like to return to their past levels of glory. The first player that comes to mind is Davide Calabria, current captain
    of milan and has been here for almost 10 years with the first team. He is error prone, slow, not good in either the offensive 
    or defensive phase and it's been like this since 2018. His backup/alternative Emerson royal isn't much better who the club signed
    from Tottenham hotspurs for 15 million euros for in the summer to the joy of every tottenham fan. he's arguably better than calabria
    but the bar is so low to begin with that it barely counts as a compliment. Another area in the team with weaknesses is the center
    back position, with the likes of both Pavlovic and Tomori consistently making errors with Malick Thiaw seeming to be solidify himself
    as the centerback partner for Matteo Gabbia, who is currently injured. Out of the defensive phase, Milan's current midfield depth
    is non existent with Tijjiani Reijnders and Youssouf Fofana being the only solid options with their replacements Ruben Loftus-Cheek 
    and Musah (who to be fair has been better in recent weeks) are both miles off pace in comparison, with the only other option being
    Ismael Bennacer who is both inconsistent as well as injury prone. And finally in the offensive positions, the striker depth is 
    poor with all three first team options for striker being injured for the game on the weekend against Cagliari, forcing the manager
    to start a 16 year old (to be fair a very talented 16 year old who's scored 500+ goals at youth level) In a league match.
    In conclusion the depth in the team is simply not good enough and it leads to milan losing points in what should be easier opponents
    for them.

<h3 style="color: darkblue;">Problem 3, The Management and Owner</h3>
<p>
    The problem many fans agree on is the most important right now is that of the ownership and the people in charge of the club right now.
    Gerry Cardinale the current president of the club seems to care solely on the construction of the new stadium for the club, which has
    been talked about since 2013 with no new actual construction or progress being made in 11 years. it seems like he may be slightly improving
    the chances of this actually happeneing but at the cost of the soccer being played on the pitch with 0 big signings since he came in 
    and a policy to not pay more than 20 million for any player. now 20 million may seem like a lot of money (because it is) but in sports
    for the big teams they're now making transfers for players with transfer fees around 50 million for players who will make a difference for them
    although milan has gotten some gems at this policy like Christian Pulisic and Tijjiani Reijnders, they've also wasted a lot of money on 
    players that simply aren't good enough using this policy like Pavlovic, Emerson Royal and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Then there is Ibrahimovic,
    Who was a great player for the club but now that he's in a role of power and say in the club, he does anything he wants except for things that'll 
    benefit the club. He'll post videos of him water boarding and Hanging around with random Youtubers all day instead of helping the club.
    I get that not everything has to be about work 24/7 but the sheer amount of times seen of him doing random things is absurd and doesn't 
    help the club. Then there's Moncada who's been moved to almost a sporting director role after he was upgraded from his role as scout. He 
    doesn't seem to have any long-term project in place and is only really signing either players who have failed at big clubs or players who are playing
    well in smaller clubs. He was also a really good scout so now that he's been pulled out of that role Milan loses a quality scout. Lastly 
    out of the management is Furlani who is the CEO of Milan right now and has been a key part in the 20 milion or less policy Milan has along side
    Cardinale and was incharge of appointing a new manager who simply isn't good enough for Milan's ambitions. These four are some of the key 
    reasons why Milan is faltering. On the next Page (Solutions)I'll explain the solutions to these three problems and how to fix them.
